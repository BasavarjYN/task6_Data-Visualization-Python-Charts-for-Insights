## 📂 Dataset
**COVID-19 Dataset**

The dataset contains country-wise COVID-19 statistics such as:
- Confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Recovered cases
- Active cases
- Weekly changes
- WHO Region classification

---

## 📊 Visualizations Performed
The following charts were created to analyze the dataset:

1. **Bar Chart**
   - Top 10 countries by total confirmed COVID-19 cases

2. **Bar Chart**
   - Total deaths by WHO Region

3. **Histogram**
   - Distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases to identify skewness and outliers

4. **Scatter Plot**
   - Relationship between confirmed cases and deaths to observe correlation

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A small number of countries contribute the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- There is a strong positive relationship between confirmed cases and deaths.
- The distribution of confirmed cases is highly right-skewed, indicating the presence of extreme outliers.
